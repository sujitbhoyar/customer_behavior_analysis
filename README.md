📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using transactional data. The goal is to uncover insights related to customer segments, spending patterns, product performance, and subscription behavior to support data-driven business decisions.
The project follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow from data loading and cleaning to SQL analysis, dashboard creation, and business reporting.

📂 Dataset
•	Type: Customer transactional data
•	Records: 3,900+ transactions
•	Features include:
o	Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status)
o	Purchase details (Product, Category, Amount, Season)
o	Shopping behavior (Discounts, Frequency, Shipping Type, Ratings)
•	Data Issues: Missing values and inconsistent column formats handled during preprocessing

🛠 Tools & Technologies
•	Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
•	Databases: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
•	Visualization: Power BI
•	Reporting: Power BI Report, Gamma (PPT)
•	Other Tools: Excel, Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Steps
1.	Data Loading
o	Imported raw dataset into Python using Pandas.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.
o	Identified spending patterns, discounts impact, and customer behavior.
3.	Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
o	Handled missing values.
o	Standardized column names.
o	Created new features such as age groups and purchase frequency.
o	Removed redundant columns.
4.	Database & SQL Analysis
o	Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server.
o	Wrote SQL queries to analyze:
	Revenue by gender and age group
	Subscriber vs non-subscriber behavior
	High-spending customers
	Top products and categories
	Discount-dependent products
	Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)
5.	Dashboard Development
o	Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs, trends, and insights.
6.	Reporting & Presentation
o	Created a structured analytical report.
o	Designed a business presentation (PPT) using Gamma for stakeholders.

📊 Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
•	Revenue trends and KPIs
•	Customer segmentation analysis
•	Product and category performance
•	Subscription and shipping insights
•	Discount impact analysis

📈 Key Results & Insights
•	Identified high-value customer segments and loyal customers.
•	Found top-performing and highly rated products.
•	Analyzed the impact of discounts and subscriptions on revenue.
•	Provided actionable insights for improving marketing, loyalty programs, and product positioning.
